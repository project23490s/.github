# Spray N’ Pray Aim Assist – Advanced Target Tracking & Accuracy Engine 🎯

The **Spray N’ Pray Aim Assist** is a precision-engineered accuracy suite built for competitive players who value control, consistency, and adaptability. Designed for PC shooters, it intelligently stabilizes your aim during firefights, balancing natural motion with pinpoint precision. From tracking fast targets to compensating recoil automatically, this software ensures every shot counts.

## 🧭 Overview

Unlike generic aim helpers, Spray N’ Pray uses adaptive tracking layers that learn your mouse movement over time. It doesn’t just pull toward targets — it *harmonizes* your sensitivity, recoil, and crosshair drag to maintain authentic control.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The tool prioritizes input balance. Always calibrate your DPI and in-game sensitivity before activating modules for best results.

## 🧠 Core Features

* **Adaptive Target Lock:** Dynamically adjusts crosshair drift to match target velocity and distance.
* **Recoil Balancer:** Cancels vertical rise and side-sway while preserving weapon feel.
* **Smooth Snap Mode:** Instantly centers on targets within your FOV arc without sharp jumps.
* **Custom Curve Sensitivity:** Define your own response curves for snipers, SMGs, or pistols.
* **Hitbox Prioritization:** Choose whether to target chest, head, or custom offset regions.
* **FOV Lock System:** Locks aim assist range (e.g., 90°–110°) to prevent overcorrection.
* **Performance Overlay:** View live metrics like aim angle, target lock time, and stability %.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q1: Does this interfere with input devices?**
No, it uses low-level readout and writes no persistent data to the driver layer.

**Q2: Can I use this for controller aim assist?**
Yes — toggle “ControllerMode=True” to match analog stick response curves.

**Q3: Does it modify online gameplay files?**
No, it operates externally and only adjusts client-side input.

**Q4: Can I disable auto-lock?**
Yes, uncheck “TargetLock” for tracking-only mode — ideal for muscle memory training.

**Q5: How often is it updated?**
After each major FPS engine patch or input system revision (about every 4–6 weeks).

## 🧩 Pro Settings Tips

* Start with **LockRadius=100** and **TrackingSpeed=1.0** for realistic motion.
* Use **Curve=“Dynamic”** for hybrid rifles and burst-fire weapons.
* Set **RecoilControl=False** if your weapon already has built-in stabilization.
* Enable **OverlayGraph=True** to monitor performance across matches.
